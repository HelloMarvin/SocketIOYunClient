## how to install the library? ##

1. Connect to the Arduino Yun via ssh

```
ssh root@myYun.local
```
2. update the packages
```
opkg update
```
3. We want to install openssh-sftp-server so that we can connect to the yun via our favorite ftp software (fliezilla, cyberduck, etc) 
 
 ```
 opkg install openssh-sftp-server
 ```
 *
 if it doesn't find the package you have tu update the repository list
 open the opkg configuration file
 
 ```
 vi /etc/opkg.conf
 ```
 and change the first line to
 ```
